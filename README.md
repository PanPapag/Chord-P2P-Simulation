# Chord-P2P-Simulation-
In this section, it is implemented a simple form of Chord, the most known type of distributed hash table. Even if Chord is used as a distributed network system, we will implement it in a computer using C programming language. All information about Chord are presented in the following link: https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/ton:chord/paper-ton.pdf . You have to read up to the page 6 to understand its functionality.  

#Run the program
1) Make
2) ./Chord
3) Select the option 3: Construct a Chord network giving an input file. 
For your help Î™ have created a .txt file with random 4-bit alpharithmetic codes.
This 4-bit codes are being given to the hash function in order to generate the Ip's of each node of the Chord network.
